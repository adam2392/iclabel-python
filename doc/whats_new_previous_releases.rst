What was new in previous releases?
==================================

Version 0.1 (2022-05-03)
------------------------

This is the first version of mne-icalabel that is released. This package
consists of a replica of the ICLabel network and pipeline present in EEGLAB
for automatically predicting the label of an ICA component and whether it
is brain signal, or noise.

We integrated our API on top of MNE-Python and provide a lightweight example
demonstrating how to use the ICLabel network.
